DawsonBoard


DawsonBoard is a page on my website (notnapoleon.net) under the random stuff section. It's basically a soundboard for Steven Dawson, a man from Ashford in Kent who has become a semi-popular meme in the UK.

I originally created DawsonBoard after people in the Steven Dawson Fan Club Discord (which I'm no longer in) suggested making a soundboard for his most notorious sound effects. However, you can use DawsonBoard as a template to make a minimal and mobile friendly soundboard that runs in your browser.


Do note that I made DawsonBoard a long time ago and no longer maintain it, hence why the CSS looks very different to the rest of my website.
